    <p>My name is Breanna. I am a 17 year old senior at The Palmdale Aerospace Academy. I've been at this school since 7th grade, so this is my 6th year here! I am Producer of Word on the Runway. In 7th grade, I was in Yearbook and I LOVED it! In 8th, I was only in it for 2nd semester. Sadly, I didn't have the chance to take it again until junior year. I juggled having a spread and working on WotR! Now this year, I proudly hold the title of Producer! In 7th grade, I met Mikaela Ruiz. I fell for her instantly, literally. I fell over a "CAUTION! WET FLOOR" sign in Carl's Jr. I was so embarrassed. Luckily, she felt the same about me. We started dating in July of 2017, so 2 years after we met.  </p>
